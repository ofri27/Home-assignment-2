hello my name is Ofri Rozolio and this is my first protfolio project. This is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills, projects, and provide information about myself. Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Sections for an introduction, skills, projects, and contact information, Use of CSS transitions for a visually appealing experience.
I faced difficulties in creating the website such as: creating the nav-bar for mobile phones. And so I used YouTube videos and GPT chat that explained how to do it.
I think that searching the Internet when I encountered a certain challenge helped me understand more about how to create a website and how to work in the right way.
